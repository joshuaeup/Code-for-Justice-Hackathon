              <h3>Trees Charlotte</h3>
              <p>Known as “The City of Trees,” Charlotte has a wonderful foundation for achieving manageable canopy goals. However, a detailed analysis shows we must take a more aggressive approach to ensure the continued health and well-being of our tree canopy, and we must actively plant thousands of trees to account for growth and development in our city and around the region. TreesCharlotte is a public/private nonprofit collaboration to grow, diversify and steward the city’s iconic urban forest. Trained volunteers and science-based programs teach residents about the value of trees and how to plant and care for them. </p> <br>

            <h3>The Big Spring Clean</h3>
            <p>A huge amount of trash gets dumped into our streams and lakes from storm drains, flooded yards, and illegal dumping. Trash degrades and pollutes recreation areas, harms wildlife, and looks terrible for our community. Each year, volunteers remove an average of 10 tons of trash! Volunteers have fun, make a big difference, and learn the importance of taking care of our local waterways.</p> <br>

            <h3>Creek ReLeaf</h3>
            <p>The Creek ReLeaf Program is a collaborative effort of the Charlotte Public Tree Fund, Charlotte Mecklenburg Storm water Services, Central Piedmont Community College, the Sierra Club Central Piedmont Group, Trees Charlotte and our dedicated volunteers and financial supporters to plant trees in riparian areas (floodplain and stream buffers) of Mecklenburg County. Through year end 2018 we have planted 23,248 trees through Creek ReLeaf and some earlier predecessor programs. We have engaged volunteers in giving 13,831 hours of community service and have also educated 4,677 volunteers on the value of trees to improve air quality, water quality and habitat.</p> <br>

            <h3>Carolina Thread Trails</h3>
            <p>The Carolina Thread Trail is a regional network of trails that connect 2.9 million people in 15 counties in North and South Carolina. The Thread Trail is an example of unprecedented regional collaboration that works to connect people and communities to nature and each other through its 1,610 miles of trails, greenways and blueways. Led by Catawba Lands Conservancy, the Carolina Thread Trail strengthens the region by promoting economic development, education, better health and land conservation.</p> <br>

              <h4>What is global warming?</h4>
              <p>Global warming refers to the increasing average global temperature since the Industrial Revolution. The average global temperature has increased by about 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880. Global warming is an ongoing process; scientists expect the average global temperature to rise an additional 0.3 to 0.7 degrees Celsius through 2035.</p>

              <h4>How is climate change affecting people?</h4>
              <p>Climate change is affecting people and ecosystmes all over the world. You may have noticed how weather patterns are shifting drastically. From severe flodding to wildfires. It is also affecting our ability to produce resources since the seasons are becoming less predictable.
              </p>
              <hr>
              <h4>How is climate change affecting the ocean</h4>
              <p>The rising temparatures are melting the polar ice, shifting the currents and fish migrations. The oceans regulate the Earth's climate by absorbing greenhouse emmissions. All of the extra absorbed carbon dioxide alters the chemistry of the ocean, making them for acidic. This negatively impacts the marine life.
              </p>

              <h4>What is the United Stated doing to combat global warming?</h4>
              <p>In 2015, President Barack Obama proposed the Clean Power Plan, which would have reduced carbon emissions from existing power plants by at least 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Substantial gains have already been made, with U.S. emissions from the power sector being at the lowest point since 1991. The Trump Administration has rolled back several of the previous administration's climate actions, including the Clean Power Plan. But states, including California and New York, are moving forward with policies to curb carbon emissions and favor renewable energy and energy efficiency.</p>
              <hr>
              <h4>Is there hope that we will be able to do something before it is too late?</h4>
              <p>Even though climate change is a pressing threat that isn’t going away, we can have a significant impact on how it affects us in the near future. By investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency, people, communities, businesses, and governments can reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions reaching the atmosphere and slow global warming. This will help minimize the consequences of climate change in the present and for future generations.</p>
