    <h1>Our beginnings</h1>
    <p>Environmental Justice Association was founded in 2020 by a group of students. 
        Their inspiration for starting the organization can be attributed to our local and global climate changing drastically.
         We proudly work with business, government agencies, and other nonprofit organizations to reduce the amount of emissions and waste we produce.</p>

    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>Environmental Justice Association is a youth led, nonprofit organization with a strong emphasis on green living and reduction of carbon waste.</p>

    <h1>Why we do it</h1>
    <p>Earth is currently facing its biggest climate problem in 30 years. 
        Back in the 90s, climate scientists stated that if we didnâ€™t do anything, the status of our ice caps would be in critical condition and rising sea levels would lead to ecosystems being destroyed.

    <h1>Statement on Politics</h1>
    <p>Environmental Justice Association is a non profit organization with tax-exempt status. We do not align,endorse, or support any political party or political candidate.
